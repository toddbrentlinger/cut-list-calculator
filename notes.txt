- Before calculating CutLists, check if largest UncutPiece length 
is equal to or larger than largest CutPiece. Display error telling 
User to either add UncutPiece long enough OR change length of 
longest CutPiece.

- If current number of available uncut lengths add up to price more than best
cut list, no need to check current configuration AND can skip checking adding
more uncut length.

- Should be able to write different format of numbers:
9'14-1/4" or 9' 14-1/4" or 9' 14 1/4" etc
9.25 (unitless value)
9.25' (9'4")
9.25" (9-1/4")

X Change getCutLists progressCallback to postMessage instead of console.log.
Back in cutListCalculator onmessage, if e.data is just a number, use as parameter 
to update progress bar instead of setting bestCutLists.

README Notes:

Worker
If pass class instance objects into worker, certain things like getters are NOT included.
[Check if it defaults prototype to Object]. Must set prototype back to appropriate type
before can use specific class attributes. [Check CutlistCalculator.getCutLists method]
